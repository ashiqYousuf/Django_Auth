#DJANGO AUTHORITZATION AND AUTHENICATION

##WHAT IT DOES?

###This is a simple DJango Application in which I have implemented Django Auth.Moreover I have added the functionality of logging in , signing in , contacting us.
###Also I have also created a dashboard for Seperate Groups Author and Admin where any Author can add post and edit any post from database additionally Admin user can delete 
###the post also.

##HOW I BUILT IT?

### I have used HTML , BOOTSTRAP in the front End and very little CSS . Django Template Language and DJANGO is mostly used througout the project.
###More focus is on Fucntion Based Views to gain more insights of writing code from scratch.Django Forms , ModelForms & Models are made here and any common User
###creates an account gets by default added to the Author Group.
